# Basics of Graphs 

## What is a graph?
Graph data structures are data structures that consist of a collection of nodes or vertices connected by edges.<br>

## Types of Graphs - 
1. Undirected Graph - No directions in edges<br>
2. Directed Graph - Directions in edges<br>
3. Weighted graph - In a weighted graph, edges have associated weights or costs.<br>
4. Cyclic Graph - A cyclic graph contains at least one cycle, which is a path that starts and ends at the same node.
5. Acyclic Graph - An acyclic graph, as the name suggests, does not contain any cycles. <br>
